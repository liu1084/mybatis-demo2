Until now simulation required the generation of a mesh and this has meant a major effort and also a source of errors.

This book will show how the generation of meshes can be avoided completely by using CAD technology. This includes using CAD data for the description of the geometry of the problem directly without approximation by a mesh and applying the functions that CAD programs use (non-uniform rational B-Splines or NURBS) to the description of the unknown. The book starts with an easy to follow introduction to NURBS and the standard data exchange format used by CAD programs. This is followed by an application to finite element shell analysis. For the modelling of solids the boundary element (BEM) is used since this is the only way mesh generation can be avoided. A computer program written in Octave/MATLAB, that has full 3-D capabilities, is introduced and used to demonstrate various steps in the analysis. Applications are in solid mechanics. Both linear and non-linear analyses are discussed and many practical examples are given.

A wide variety of problems in artificial intelligence are solved using the constraint satisfaction problem paradigm. However, there are several applications in multi-agent coordination that are of a distributed nature. In this type of application, the knowledge about the problem, that is, variables and constraints, may be logically or geographically distributed among physical distributed agents. This distribution is mainly due to privacy and/or security requirements. Therefore, a distributed model allowing a decentralized solving process is more adequate to model and solve such kinds of problem. The distributed constraint satisfaction problem has such properties.

This is the rationale of biased rationality. However, not everything leads us always to a good decision. Some people are not satisfied with weak arguments or it-is-just-so strategies. They want something better. This second attitude points to a different form of rationality that takes advantage of the idea of distributed cognition. Basically, human beings improve their survival strategies by building cognitive niches capable of delivering potentially ever more symptomatic information. It is through various manipulations of the environment that we gain new and more reliable chances which can be used to de-bias our rationality. Through the laborious activity of cognitive niche construction, we come up with situations in which we are better afforded by our environment, and thus biases or fallacies cease to be appealing.', '135605af93372a9.jpeg', 'Emanuele Bardone', '3642196322', '2011', '182', 'English', '1.94', 'PDF', '0', '0', '2017-08-12 23:31:38', '0000-00-00 00:00:00');

However, this one is exceptional to certain extent. The whole textbook is designed as a record of the dialogue of the author with his daughter who wants to learn programming. The author endeavors not to explain the Java programming language to the readers, but to teach them real programming. To teach them how to think and design the program as the experienced programmers do. Entire matter is explained in a very illustrative way which means even a current secondary school student can understand it quite simply. The book comes out of the author&#8217;s long-term experience with teaching children, university students as well as professional programmers. The author teaches programming according to the Architecture First methodology which reacts at the companies&#8217; complaints that the school graduates are usually good in coding, but bad in software architecture. Coding itself is gradually taken over by various code-generators, but the work of the architect will stay irreplaceable for a long time. The author pursues the pedagogical principle saying that those items considered as the most important should be presented as soon as possible. Therefore he leads the readers to apply the proper design of the architecture of the created program and to avoid common mistakes since the very beginning. For designing the programs, the development environment BlueJ is used, which is proposed specially for the beginners and which enables explaining, demonstrating and programming a number of basic architectonic constructs without leaving the architectonic level and degrading to the code level. The book is divided into three parts. The first one deals with the explanation of basic constructs of the object oriented programming and all proposed programs are created by the code-generator incorporated in BlueJ. The second part repeats the explained constructs and the readers can learn how to code the proposed program similarly as was done by the generator in the first part. The third part presents constructs which are beyond the bounds of abilities of the used code-generator, and therefore the readers have to program them themselves. Despite that, the explanation core keeps in the level of architecture. The book is determined above all for complete beginners. However, the experience proved that even the intermediate programmers can find a lot of interesting and informative in it.', 'OOP-Learn-Object-Oriented-Thinking-and-Programming.jpg', 'Rudolf Pecinovsky', '8090466184', '2013', '528', 'English', '5.92', 'PDF', '0', '0', '2017-08-12 23:31:38', '0000-00-00 00:00:00');

Then check out SSH, the Secure Shell, which provides key-based authentication and transparent encryption for your network connections. It&#8217;s reliable, robust, and reasonably easy to use, and both free and commercial implementations are widely available for most operating systems. While it doesn&#8217;t solve every privacy and security problem, SSH eliminates several of them very effectively.Everything you want to know about SSH is in our second edition of SSH, The Secure Shell: The Definitive Guide. This updated book thoroughly covers the latest SSH-2 protocol for system administrators and end users interested in using this increasingly popular TCP/IP-based solution.How does it work? Whenever data is sent to the network, SSH automatically encrypts it. When data reaches its intended recipient, SSH decrypts it. The result is &#8220;transparent&#8221; encryption-users can work normally, unaware that their communications are already encrypted. SSH supports secure file transfer between computers, secure remote logins, and a unique &#8220;tunneling&#8221; capability that adds encryption to otherwise insecure network applications. With SSH, users can freely navigate the Internet, and system administrators can secure their networks or perform remote administration.Written for a wide, technical audience, SSH, The Secure Shell: The Definitive Guide covers several implementations of SSH for different operating systems and computing environments. Whether you&#8217;re an individual running Linux machines at home, a corporate network administrator with thousands of users, or a PC/Mac owner who just wants a secure way to telnet or transfer files between machines, our indispensable guide has you covered. It starts with simple installation and use of SSH, and works its way to in-depth case studies on large, sensitive computer networks.No matter where or how you&#8217;re shipping information, SSH, The Secure Shell: The Definitive Guide will show you how to do it securely.', 'SSH-The-Secure-Shell-2nd-Edition.jpg', 'Daniel Barrett', '0596008953', '2005', '668', 'English', '5.1', 'PDF', '0', '0', '2017-08-12 23:31:38', '0000-00-00 00:00:00');

We describe surfaces as display technologies with which people can interact directly, and emphasize how interaction design changes when designing for large surfaces. We review efforts to use large displays, surfaces or mixed display environments to enable collaborative analytic activity. Collaborative analysis is important in many domains, but to provide concrete examples and a specific focus, we frequently consider analysis work in the security domain, and in particular the challenges security personnel face in securing networks from attackers, and intelligence analysts encounter when analyzing intelligence data. Both of these activities are becoming increasingly collaborative endeavors, and there are huge opportunities for improving collaboration by leveraging surface computing. This work highlights for interaction designers and software developers the particular challenges and opportunities presented by interaction with surfaces. We have reviewed hundreds of recent research papers, and report on advancements in the fields of surface-enabled collaborative analytic work, interactive techniques for surface technologies, and useful theory that can provide direction to interaction design work. We also offer insight into issues that arise when developing applications for multi-touch surfaces derived from our own experiences creating collaborative applications.

Along the way, the reader is introduced to numerous tools included in the standard Ruby distribution&#8211;tools like the task manager Rake and the interactive Ruby console-based interpreter Irb&#8211;that facilitate Ruby development and make it an integrated and pleasant experience. The book encompasses advanced topics, like the design of Ruby&#8217;s class and module system, and the use of Ruby threads, taking even the new Rubyist deep into the language and giving every reader the foundations necessary to use, explore, and enjoy this unusually popular and versatile language.

From the best selling author of the Top 100 Tips for Windows 8. Hello, Iâ€™m Tim Sievers. Iâ€™ve used every Microsoft Operating System (OS) since the days of MS-DOS in the 1980â€™s and over the years Iâ€™ve seen huge improvements in usability and design. I would never have imagined how far PCâ€™s have come since then. However, looking back there were a few bumps along the road, with Windows Vista and more recently Windows 8 being some of the least popular versions of the OS. Vista was a visually stunning OS let down by poor performance on a wide range of hardware, while Windows 8 was a radical redesign that never really took off. Microsoftâ€™s mission with Windows 10 is to combine the best features of Windows 7 and 8 to give the 1.5 billion Windows Users around the world a reason to upgrade. The return of the Start menu and a free upgrade offer for Windows 7 and 8.1 users is a good beginning, but Windows 10 offers so much more. Designed to help you get up to speed quickly, this guide is a collection of the best 100 tips that I have found for Windows 10. Because Windows 10 is built for both touchscreen and traditional computing devices I have included both touchscreen gesture and keyboard/mouse instructions. Also, as a bonus extra, I have included a list of the most common Windows 10 Keyboard Shortcuts. This handy reference is divided into several categories to help you quickly find the shortcut you need, when you need it. So, whether youâ€™ve just started using Windows 10 or youâ€™ve been using it for a while, Iâ€™m sure youâ€™ll find some useful tips here that will improve your Windows 10 experience.', '295649121b144e3.jpeg', 'Tim Sievers', '1517323010', '2015', '148', 'English', '5.81', 'PDF', '0', '0', '2017-08-12 23:31:38', '0000-00-00 00:00:00');

In the early 1970s Codd formalized databases in terms of the relational calculus and the relational algebra. A major influence on the use of logic in databases was the development of the field of logic programming. Logic provides a convenient formalism for studying classical database problems and has the important property of being declarative, that is, it allows one to express what she wants rather than how to get it. For a long time, relational calculus and algebra were considered the relational database languages. However, there are simple operations, such as computing the transitive closure of a graph, which cannot be expressed with these languages. Datalog is a declarative query language for relational databases based on the logic programming paradigm. One of the peculiarities that distinguishes Datalog from query languages like relational algebra and calculus is recursion, which gives Datalog the capability to express queries like computing a graph transitive closure. Recent years have witnessed a revival of interest in Datalog in a variety of emerging application domains such as data integration, information extraction, networking, program analysis, security, cloud computing, ontology reasoning, and many others.

Traditional product development process does not fit well for OSH approach and hence an appropriate process needs to be established, that makes product development with OSH approach easy, effective and fun experience.

Other features are taken from more dynamic Scripting languages as well as from Functional languages. It is a language, a complier, and a framework of classes designed to help developers write clean code. It opens up the world of application development and reduces the learning curve while minimizing potential roadblocks. It is difficult to write a book on haXe because there are so many possibilities that the language can provide. It is able to target three platforms: JavaScript, Flash, and Neko. It opens a lot of doors for web developers. The combination of these different technologies makes it possible to create things today that were hard to imagine yesterday. haXe makes it possible to develop applications targeting multiple platforms very quickly. Neko is a cross-platform virtual machine and it acts as one of the targets of the haXe complier. It is lightweight, fast, and flexible. It can be embedded and requires a small footprint that makes it practically invisible. When combined with haXe, it can open a lot of doors to pure web development (e.g., real-time servers and console and desktop applications). This book is for web developers who would like to work with a unified environment while at the same time reducing the number of languages required to produce a single software solution. Although you don&#8217;t have to be a veteran programmer to utilize the information in this book, it helps if you have already programmed in ActionScript, Java, or another ECMA standard language. The material in this book is split into three parts based on the content that each part is discussing. The first part of the book focuses mainly on the basics of the haXe programming language. Details are given about the language structure, standard libraries, and programming practices. If you are an experienced haXe programmer you can probably skip this section. Those who are familiar with programming but are new to haXe can go through the first section easily and look mainly at the code examples and tables that detail the classes and commands required to develop in haXe. The second part of the book covers the practical uses of haXe, including the production of Flash movies and dynamic content for websites. This part is useful to programmers of any skill level. This section also contains references to platform-specific classes defined in the standard library (the core framework that comes with the haXe base installation). The third part of the book is dedicated to the advanced developer who wants to use haXe for all it has to offer. It also discusses how to extend haXe with existing libraries or how to use haXe outside of the conventional web environment. In order to use this book you need to have a computer that operates on Windows, Linux, or either type of Apple Macintosh. All of the tools described in the book are open source and are available for download on the internet (for free!). Franco Ponticelli graduated with a degree in architecture with a specialization in industrial design.

INSERT INTO `books` VALUES ('3955', 'Professional iPhone Programming with MonoTouch and .NET/C#', 'What .NET C# developers need to enter the hot field of iPhone apps iPhone applications offer a hot opportunity for developers. Until the open source MonoTouch project, this field was limited to those familiar with Apple&#8217;s programming languages. Now .NET and C# developers can join the party. Professional iPhone Programming with MonoTouch and .NET/C# is the first book to cover MonoTouch, preparing developers to take advantage of this lucrative opportunity. This book is for .NET developers that are interested in creating native iPhone applications written in .NET/C#. These developers want to use their existing knowledge. While .NET developers are always interested in learning, they also recognize that learning Objective-C and the specifics of the iPhone can be overwhelming. Those developers interested in MonoTouch will recognize that the cost of MonoTouch is easily made up by the ability to quickly target the iPhone using a language that they are already familiar with. This book is designed for .NET developers that want to target the iPhone. It is designed to help you get up to speed with the iPhone, not to really teach you about the .N ET Framework or C# language, which we assume you already know. This book is designed with introductory material in Chapters 1 thru 4. You should read Chapters 1 thru 4 sequentially. These chapters introduce the MonoTouch product, the basics of developing with MonoTouch and MonoDevelop, and finally, the basics of presenting data to a user with screen and data controls and how to develop a user interface for the iPhone. Once you are comfortable with these concepts, you can typically move from one chapter to another and not necessarily have to read the chapters sequentially. Chapter 1 &#8220;Introduction to iPhone Development with MonoTouch for C# Developers&#8221; This chapter looks at how the largest segment of developers can target the smartphone with the highest mindshare, and that the smartphone is growing faster in marketshare than any other device. Chapter 2 &#8220;Introduction to MonoTouch&#8221; gives you a firm foundation in MonoTouch, MonoDevelop, Interface Builder, debugging, and deploying. Chapter 3 &#8220;Planning Your App&#8217;s UI: Exploring the Screen Controls&#8221; teaches you about creating your application&#8217;s UI and specifically how the UI on the iPhone can differ from UIs that you might have created before. You also explore the Input &amp; Value objects from the Interface Builder Objects Library. Chapter4 &#8220;Data Controls&#8221; shows the Interface Builder Objects Library Cocoa Touch classes for Controllers, Data Views, and Windows, Views, &amp; Bars. Chapter 5 &#8220;Working with Data on the iPhone&#8221; looks at the SQLite database engine as well as strategies to store data off the device on a central server through SOAP and REST (using XML and JSON) without tying up the user interface. Chapter 6 &#8220;Displaying Data Using Tables&#8221; looks at displaying information in a table, using tables for navigation, taking advantage of UITableView&#8217;s built-in editing features, and adding a search bar to a table. Chapter 7 &#8220;Mapping&#8221; covers CoreLocation and MapKit, using Location Services, and adding maps and geocoding to your application. Chapter 8 &#8220;Application Settings&#8221; focuses on application settings, and looks at two aspects of settings for your MonoTouch app: the Info.plist and your settings bundle. It covers what settings you might want to set in your Info.plist and why, and then looks at what code it takes to read and use the settings that you save in the settings bundle. And it also takes you through the building of the settings that you might have in a social media-type application. Going through each step, you will examine the Root.plist inside the Property List Editor and see the settings dialog that will result from it. Chapter 9 &#8220;Programming with Device Hardware&#8221; covers accelerometer device orientation, and proximity detection support, networking, and developing with battery life in mind. Chapter 10 &#8220;Programming with Multimedia&#8221; discussing integrating images and the image picker, watching and recording videos, playing and recording audio, and using animation Chapter 11 &#8220;Talking to Other Applications&#8221; discusses the ways you can use MonoTouch to talk to other applications on the iPhone, both Apple-built applications and those downloaded from the App Store. It also provides helpful ways of accessing the iPhone&#8217;s Address Book and the iPod music library. Chapter 12 &#8220;Localizing for an International Audience&#8221; first defines internationalization and localization, then shows displaying translated text and images, formatting dates, times, and numbers, then extracting text for translation. Chapter 13 &#8220;Programming the iPad &#8221; the capabilities of the iPad are, what new APIs and controls have been introduced that you can use in iPad-specific applications, and how to build applications that can work on both iPad and iPhone devices. Chapter 14 &#8220;Just Enough Objective-C&#8221; provides you with a reference and introduction to Objective-C that will help you acquire an ability to comprehend Objective-C which is something that will come in very handy. Chapter 15 &#8220;The App Store: Submitting and Marketing Your App&#8221; discusses all things App Store. First, it talks about the process that you need to go through before you are ready to submit &#8211; this includes final testing with Ad-Hoc builds and a presubmission checklist. Next it addresses actually submitting to the App Store, and then finally what to do with your app after it&#8217;s in the App Store.

This was a major theme of the first edition of this book and the fourth edition expands and further illustrates this relationship. As in the earlier editions, the material in this fourth edition is organized into three separate parts. Part I is a self-contained introduction to linear programming. The presentation in this part is fairly conventional, covering the main elements of the underlying theory of linear programming, many of the most effective numerical algorithms, and many of its important special applications. Part II, which is independent of Part I, covers the theory of unconstrained optimization, including both derivations of the appropriate optimality conditions and an introduction to basic algorithms. This part of the book explores the general properties of algorithms and defines various notions of convergence. Part III extends the concepts developed in the second part to constrained optimization problems. Except for a few isolated sections, this part is also independent of Part I. It is possible to go directly into Parts II and III omitting Part I, and, in fact, the book has been used in this way in many universities.', '2355d8121758b65.jpeg', 'David G.

The effects of this revolution and its ethical implications are wide-ranging. This book includes the opinions of myriad investigators, practitioners, and stakeholders in big data on human beings who also routinely reflect on the privacy and ethical issues of this phenomenon. Dedicated to the practice of ethical reasoning and reflection in action, the book offers a range of observations, lessons learned, reasoning tools, and suggestions for institutional practice to promote responsible big data research on human affairs. It caters to a broad audience of educators, researchers, and practitioners. Educators can use the volume in courses related to big data handling and processing. Researchers can use it for designing new methods of collecting, processing, and disseminating big data, whether in raw form or as analysis results.

And that&#8217;s perfectly fine, there should be books like that, the tutorials that teach the concepts. However, that also means that when it comes to examples, there&#8217;s usually not enough space to provide all the details about them and their variations, otherwise the book would become huge or oftentimes lose its focus. The result of that is that making a step further from the provided calculations and queries might not be an easy task for an average reader. The other problem with tutorials is that the solution to a particular problem might be scattered throughout the book, which is where the cookbook style of books like this one come into play. Similar to data warehouses where we consolidate many tables of the relational database into a few and then organize those dimension tables in a topic-based star schema, in cookbooks we aggregate the information about a particular problem in form of one or more recipes and present that topic-based knowledge in full detail. Both the relational databases and the data warehouses have their purpose; it&#8217;s not uncommon to see them together in one place. The same is true about books and their approaches. What we also know is that there are far too few data warehouses than relational databases. Again, the same is with MDX-related cookbooks in respect to MDX tutorials, particularly those dealing with advanced topics. As a writer, I hope you recognize my intention and the value this book could bring you. As a reader, we rarely have enough time to start reading a book, not to mention f nish it.

The syntax and semantics of several languages for representing preference languages, including CP-nets, TCP-nets, CI-nets, and CP-theories, are reviewed. Some key problems in reasoning about preferences are introduced, including determining whether one alternative is preferred to another, or whether they are equivalent, with respect to a given set of preferences. These tasks can be reduced to model checking in temporal logic. Specifically, an induced preference graph that represents a given set of preferences can be efficiently encoded using a Kripke Structure for Computational Tree Logic (CTL). One can translate preference queries with respect to a set of preferences into an equivalent set of formulae in CTL, such that the CTL formula is satisfied whenever the preference query holds. This allows us to use a model checker to reason about preferences, i.e., answer preference queries, and to obtain a justification as to why a preference query is satisfied (or not) with respect to a set of preferences. This book defines the notions of the equivalence of two sets of preferences, including what it means for one set of preferences to subsume another, and shows how to answer preferential equivalence and subsumption queries using model checking. Furthermore, this book demontrates how to generate alternatives ordered by preference, along with providing ways to deal with inconsistent preference specifications.

Effective and accurate numerical solutions for the calculation of the percentile response time in single-class and multi-class queueing networks are obtained. Then, the numerical solution is incorporated in a resource allocation problem. Specifically, the authors present an approach for the resource optimization that minimizes the total cost of computer resources required while preserving a given percentile of the response time. In the second part, the approach is extended to consider trustworthiness, service availability, and the percentile of response time in Web services. These QoS metrics are clearly defined and their quantitative analysis provided. The authors then take into account these QoS metrics in a trust-based resource allocation problem in which a set of cloud computing resources is used by a service provider to host a typical Web services application for single-class customer services and multipleclass customer services respectively.

However, their in-depth analysis of these two techniques shows that PKTAPP does not perform better than PKCROSS in a large-scale system.

Traditionally, mathematical gradient-based optimal techniques have been applied to the design of optimal structures. While, many practical engineering optimal problems are very complex and hard to solve by traditional method. In the past few decades, swarm intelligence algorithms, which were inspired by the social behaviour of natural animals such as fish schooling and bird flocking, were developed because they do not require conventional mathematical assumptions and thus possess better global search abilities than the traditional optimization algorithms and have attracted more and more attention. These intelligent based algorithms are very suitable for continuous and discrete design variable problems such as ready-made structural members and have been vigorously applied to various structural design problems and obtained good results. This book gathers the authorsâ€™ latest research work related with particle swarm optimizer algorithm and group search optimizer algorithm as well as their application to structural optimal design.
